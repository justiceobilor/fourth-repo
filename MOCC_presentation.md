Introduction
============

Introduction
------------

In the first generation models by Krugman (1979), the domestic process
is exogenous, then the bank reserves bear the adjustment burden to
balance of payments. If the authorities pursue inconsistent
macroeconomic policies with the fixed exchange rate, there will be a
speculative attack that will deplete the foreign reserves and force the
government to let the exchange rate to float at a depreciated level.
These useful models that properly described the Latin American crises,
failed to explain why some countries experienced currency crises despite
its governments budget did not have a deficit and the foreign reserves
levels were appropriate.

Introduction
------------

This was the case of some European countries in the early nineties, for
instance Sweden. One year after the Riksbank announced a unilateral peg
to the European Currency Unit (ECU), the Danish rejection of Maastricht
treaty in 1992 triggered attacks to fixed exchange rates in Europe
(specially to Nordic currencies), as well as rose the interest rate.
Even though the fundamentals of the Swedish economy were strong enough
to resist the attacks for months following the commitment to the long
term credibility of the anchor rule, at the end of the year the
government decided to let the currency float.

Introduction
------------

Obstfeld (1994) suggested that first generation models do not take into
account the policy options of the government to cope the crises, nor
analyzed the costs and trade off of policies and costs of keeping the
fixed exchange rate. For these reason the author proposed two models for
the so called self-fulfilling crises, in which the government’s
responses to market expectations are endogenous.

Role of Nominal interest rates
==============================

In a world with two periods, a government can issue domestic currency
units and participates in the market for foreign currency units. This
government in the period 1, must pay to claimants an amount of domestic
currency unit, $D_0^1$, and an amount in period 2 of $D_0^2$. These
terms must be understood as the intertemporal endowments of liabilities,
hence whether $D_0^1=0$ any the debt is long term, and with $D_0^2=0$
the debt is short term.

Role of Nominal interest rates
------------------------------

Parallel the government in period 1 is entitled to receive payments of
foreign currency, $f_0^1$ , and an amount in period 2 of $f_0^2$.
Moreover the levels of its consumption in two periods, $g_1$ and $g_2$
are given exogenously. In this model where PPP is assumed, in period 1
the fixed exchange rate (E1) may change in period 2 (E2) . The last
assumption is that governments can increase its proceeds by levying
taxes in period 2.

The government has an objective function that takes into account the
negative effects of inflation and depreciation, (Ɛ), and tax rate (τ).
Firstly the equation is: 

$$£=  1/2 τ^2+  θ/2 ε^2 (1)$$

Role of Nominal interest rates
------------------------------

In period 2, the government chooses Ɛ and τ and minimize this loss
function subject to a constraint of its position in period 2 when it
should meet all the obligations. The revenue to finance the liabilities
is obtained from foreign currency assets, taxes, the output (y) and the
amount of money hold by resident in period 2 $(M_2-M_1)$. Thus the
expression that summarize the constraint is:

$$〖              D〗_1^2+ D_0^2- E_2 (f_1^2+ f_0^2 )+E_2 g_2  = E_2 t y+M_2-M_1               (2)$$

Role of Nominal interest rates
------------------------------

The same equation can be expressed in terms of depreciation rate(ε), and
the real value at the of the domestic currency government debt payment
promise on date t (d).

$$ε(d_1^2+d_0^2+ky)+ty= d_1^2+d_0^2+g_2-f_1^2-f_0^2     (3)$$

The minimization of (1) subject to (3) allowed to Obstfeld (1994) show
that in an optimum, the marginal cost of extra depreciation per domestic
currency unit raised equals the marginal cost per domestic currency unit
of higher conventional taxes.

Role of Nominal interest rates
------------------------------

Another minimization of (1) is required, this time subject to two
constraints: The first is related to capital mobility and uncovered
interest-rate parity that ensures equality of domestic and foreign asset
returns :

$$1+i=(E_2/E_1 )  (1+i^*)       (4)$$

The other constraint is the private money demand, whose equation is:

$$M_t=k E_t y      (5)$$

Role of Nominal interest rates
------------------------------

The outcome of the optimizations are the government reaction function
curve (the first minimization described), and the interest parity curve
(the second minimization). Obstfeld (1994) also calculated the
minimizations with a modified loss function of the government when
includes the cost of abandoning the fixed exchange rate, associated to
political embarrassment and lost of credibility. When this cost
surpassed by the loss, the government will be force to devalue.

Role of Nominal interest rates
------------------------------

The interception of the curves displays that having multiple
equilibriums is likely. Regarding the latter, it can be considered a
scenario where the market do not expect a devaluation and actually there
is no devaluation so it is possible to keep the fix exchange rate. If
suddenly the market participants think that the government is trying to
surprise the market with a depreciation in order to rise economic growth
(by reducing the interest rates), the expectation leads to a real
devaluation since augments the cost of keeping the peg (Eijffinger and
Goderis, 2007). In this sense, this result is different to the obtained
in the first generation model, once that the lasts only may reach one
equilibrium .

Role of aggregate demand shocks
===============================

Role of aggregate demand shocks
-------------------------------

The second model of Obstfeld (1994) shows that a regime of fixed but
adjustable parities can engender multiple equilibria and in some of them
the economy will be worse than under fixed exchange rates, owing to
expectation of growth of wage that negatively affect the competitiveness
and force devaluations.

Role of aggregate demand shocks
-------------------------------

In this model of aggregate demand, where PPP is assumed, the domestic
output $y_t$is:

$$y_t= ∝(e_t-w_t )- u_t       (1)$$

Role of aggregate demand shocks
-------------------------------

Where $e_t$ is the home-currency price of the foreign exchange $w_t$ is
money wage and u is a mean zero. In this equation can be seen that the
government only is able to respond to demand shocks is by changing the
exchange rate in date t, since the wages were already fixed. Now the
government tries to minimize a loss function (as was seen in the first
model), this time incorporate level of exchange rate and output, the
equation is the following:

$$£_t=∑_(s=t)^∝▒β^(s-t)  [θ(e_s-e_(s-t) )+〖(y_s-y^*)〗^2 ]       (2)$$

Role of aggregate demand shocks
-------------------------------

This loss function can be combined with (1), and the government must
choose the currency exchange rate Government chooses currency’s exchange
rate as it was mentioned to minimize l (over e\_t) given the nominal
wages agreed in period t-1

$$l_t=  θ/2 〖(e_t-e_(1-l))〗^2+1/2 [∝(e_t-w_t )- u_t-y*]^2     (3)$$

After the minimization, Obstfeld (1994) showed that the goverment’s
desire to offset negative shocks can trigger a devaluation that would
not have occurred under different private expectations.

Role of aggregate demand shocks
-------------------------------

The defensive measures to defend the fixed exchange rate, such as,
raising interest rates to cope the expectations of devaluation,
borrowing foreign reserves, reduce the government’s borrowing
requirements or Impose exchange controls, although effective, are
costly, especially when the economies have trade off related to economic
downturn or high unemployment rates.

Role of aggregate demand shocks
-------------------------------

The second generation models allow to see that the dynamic preferences
and constraints of the governments are endogenous through the market
expectations, so a country with a peg or semi pegged system may face a
currency crisis even if it has strong fundamentals, once that it might
become too costly to try to maintain the fixed exchange rate.

Criticism to first and second generation models
===============================================

Criticism to first and second generation models
-----------------------------------------------

The shortcomings of the first and second generation models were seen in
the context of the Asian crisis, then the recent literature have focused
on the improvement of the models. For instance Kaminsky & Reinhart
(1999) pointed that despite some Asian countries had a stable inflation,
an economic boom and fiscal surpluses, nevertheless these countries
experienced a severe currency crisis owing to factors such as weak
regulation of the banking system.

Criticism to first and second generation models
-----------------------------------------------

These variables, which are omitted in
the first and second generation models, may have undesirable
consequences over the balance sheets of highly leverage companies or the
banking system. Burnside, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2001a) stated that that
a currency crisis could begin even before the government actually starts
to print money (as the first generation model predicts) since other
aspects must be taken into account and Krugman (1999) highlighted the
need to incorporate variables related to financial fragility.

Conclusions
===========

Conclusions
-----------

The First generation models which was given birth to by the work of
Krugman attempted to provide explanations regarding the Latin Debt
Crisis. The key characteristic in the first generation model is that a
small open economy under a fixed exchange rate regime will switch to a
flexible or floating exchange as a result of a speculative attack on the
domestic currency. As discussed above its assumptions could not hold
ground in explaining future crisis, however the models assisted in
future research work.

Conclusions
-----------

The second generation models developed by Obstfeld (1994), provided
explanations to the currency crisis of some European countries and
improve the first generation models since they incorporated the notion
of tradeoff between the maintenance of a fixed Exchange rate and
pursuing expansionary monetary policies. Moreover the result showed that
it is possible to have multiple equilibrium given the dynamic
preferences of the governments.

Conclusions
-----------

The first and second generation models were useful theoretical
frameworks to understand currency crises, although some progress have
been made since the Asian crisis of 1997. The third generation models
include the soundness of the financial system, as well as the existence
of appropriate regulation (among other aspects), in order to explain in
a better way this kind of economic crisis, which are still likely even
when many countries have opted for a float Exchange rate regime.
